# linedetect
ESP32-cam code for line detection

This is an initial commit for line detection.
It is not my own work but based on code from a PI wars mini conference 2019.
Computer vision from scratch by Brian Starkey.

This code grabs an image and displays it on a web page, the user can select between raw and processed video.

The line is detected on about 30 rows in the centre of the image and takes less than 6msecs to process
